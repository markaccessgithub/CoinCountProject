This project was made for an imaginary scenario where a fundraiser raised money, and volunteers could sort bags of each type of coin (using the bag's weight to ensure that the coutning was correct), 
and then input the bag into the program in order to count the total money raised. The program also keeps track of each volunteer's accuracy and bags sorted.

Simply download both files into the same folder and the program should work as intended
